# Miscellaneous Codes

## arduino_motor_code:
   Generating PWM values for motors of a differential drive bot through a joystick using an Arduino. Contains scripts for an arduino joystick module as well as a Nintendo Wii Nunchuk which uses the I2C communication protocol.
   
## basic_atmega:
   Basic Atmega microcontroller coding, blinking LEDs, timers, interrupts and debouncing.
   
## gps_imu_sensors:
   Integrating HMC5883L, MPU8050 and a Garmin USB GPS using a Raspberry Pi. Also contains a simple traversal algorithm script using these modules. 
   
## joystick:
   Scripts to generate PWM values for motors of a differential drive bot through a USB joystick and transfer these values to a Raspberry Pi through a USBTTL module.
   
## point_cloud_processing:
   Voxel Grid filtering, Plane Segmentation and Clustering on a kinect pointcloud and publishing output on ROS topics.
   
## sockets:
   Sending and Receiving camera feed through sockets. Threading of multiple camera feeds.
